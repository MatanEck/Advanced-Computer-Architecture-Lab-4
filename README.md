Lab #4: Processor Verilog Implementation

In this lab, we'll complete the design cycle by implementing the processor micro
architecture in the Verilog hardware description language and perform verification against the low-level simulator which we
designed in lab #2.

The high-level ISS simulator generated an instruction trace file. The low-level simulator generated two trace files: an
instruction trace, which was binary compared to the ISS trace to verify the match between high and low level simulators, as
well as a cycle trace.

In the lab today, the Verilog implementation will output an identical cycle trace, which we will binary compare against the
cycle trace from the low-level simulator to verify the hardware implementation matches the simulation.
